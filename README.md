This project is about just making a nice little website where somone can go in and just enjoy themeselves.
See a picture of a cat with some soothing colors. Don't like the colors that are there? Just refresh the

# Development Environment

I used Virtual Studio code for the actual coding of the site. Along with git hub to keep all the files
together in a repository. I also used css, html, and java script all together to create the website.
